    <h1>Information about Mary Barsoum!</h1>
    <p>
      Hey Y'all. My Name is Mary Barsoum and I am a member of the 2023 class. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am completing my BS/MS at WPI. My undergrad is in Biomedical Engineering, with a minor in Mechanical Engineering. I am hoping to join the MCS Masters program (pending some paperwork).
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't really taken many CS courses at WPI. Most of my coding experience is from High School course work and internships. Howvever, I have taken Data Visualization and CS 5007. I am currently taking CS 5008, CS 513, and CS 509, along with this course, towards my MCS.
