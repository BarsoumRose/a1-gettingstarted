      Hey Y'all. My Name is Mary Barsoum and I am a member of the class of 2023. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am completing my BS/MS at WPI. My undergrad is in Biomedical Engineering, with a minor in Mechanical Engineering. I am hoping to join the MCS Masters program (pending some paperwork).
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't really completed many CS courses at WPI. Most of my coding experience is from high school course work and internships. Howvever, I have taken CS480x and CS5008. I am currently taking CS 5008, CS 513, and CS 509, along with this course, towards my MCS. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I like to cook and bake. I love having people over and using them as guinea pigs for my cooking :). I also love reading and wood burning. 
      </p>
